        <p>This is the first paragraph of our article about web typography. Typography is more than just choosing beautiful fonts; it's about shaping the reading experience. Good typography establishes a strong visual hierarchy, provides a graphic balance to the website, and sets the product’s overall tone. <mark>Readability is key</mark>.</p>
        
        <p>The second paragraph delves deeper into the principles of font pairing. It is crucial not to use too many fonts. A common rule of thumb is to use a maximum of three fonts, which creates a clean, uncluttered look. The goal is to choose fonts that complement each other.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "Good typography is like a good waiter; you should never notice it. But when it's bad, it's all you can see."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Another important aspect is spacing, also known as whitespace. This includes line spacing (leading), character spacing (tracking), and the margins between paragraphs. <mark>Proper spacing</mark> makes text easier to scan and digest, reducing reader fatigue.</p>
        
        <p>This is the fourth paragraph. We explore the use of different font weights and styles, like bold and italic, to create emphasis and guide the reader's eye through the content. Strategic use of these styles can significantly improve the clarity of the text.</p>

        <p>Finally, the last paragraph summarizes the importance of responsive typography. Text must be legible and aesthetically pleasing on all devices, from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors. Using relative units like 'rem' can help achieve this flexibility.</p>
