    <title>Question 18: Quotations</title>
</head>

    <h1>Using Quotations in HTML</h1>

    <p>
        When you need to quote a short phrase, you can use the &lt;q&gt; tag.
        For example, he said, <q>Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.</q>
        It automatically adds quotation marks.
    </p>

    <p>For longer, block-level quotations, the &lt;blockquote&gt; tag is more appropriate:</p>

    <blockquote>
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web.
        It is responsible for developing protocols &amp; guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web.
